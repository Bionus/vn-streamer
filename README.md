Visual novel streamer that you can run on a computer to then be able to play remotely. Simply run the server program on the computer, link it to a visual novel, and you're ready to play on the go!

The server only works on Windows at the moment, due to the heavy usage of the WinApi.

As for the client, the HTML5 one uses WebSockets and can therefore work on any browser that supports them, on desktop or mobile.
